# www.devdispatch.com,  An online multiplayer card game similar to "What do you meme", with GIFS instead of pictures. 

## I'll attempt to give you a walkthrough of what this game is, and how it works. But first, a few things.

### Why is it called devDispatch... What does that have to do with a card game?
#### Well... I had originally purchased the domain to host a code bootcamp team project, but we never actually got around to hosting it. Since it was sitting dormant, I decided to use it for this, my first post-bootcamp project.


### How does the game work?
#### After a game is created(I'll talk more about how that works in a bit), each user is presented with the same GIF.
